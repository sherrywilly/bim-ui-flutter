## 1. Introduction
This Flutter project, named `testflutter` in its `pubspec.yaml`, serves as a foundational UI for a BIM (Building Information Modeling) system. Flutter's cross-platform capabilities allow this application to run seamlessly on Android, iOS, and web platforms. The project aims to provide an intuitive and interactive user interface for interacting with BIM data, though the specific functionalities are not detailed in the provided project structure. It is structured to facilitate development and maintenance, with clear separation of concerns for UI components and business logic.




## 2. Features
While specific features are not explicitly defined in the provided project files, a typical BIM UI Flutter application would include:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on Android, iOS, and Web from a single codebase.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides a rich and responsive user interface for BIM data visualization and interaction.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into `screens`, `widgets`, and `constants` for maintainability and scalability.
- **Data Visualization**: Potentially integrates with backend services to display BIM models, properties, and analytics.
- **User Input**: Allows users to interact with BIM elements, modify properties, or trigger actions.
- **Theming**: Utilizes `hexcolor` for custom color definitions, suggesting a themed or branded UI.




## 3. Technologies Used
- **Framework**: Flutter SDK (version >=2.7.0 <3.0.0)
- **Language**: Dart
- **Dependencies**:
  - `cupertino_icons`: ^1.0.2 (for iOS style icons)
  - `hexcolor`: ^2.0.0 (for handling hex color values)
- **Development Dependencies**:
  - `flutter_test` (for unit and widget testing)




## 4. Installation and Setup
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured. You can find installation instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Dart SDK**: The Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter, so it will be installed automatically.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with the Flutter extension, or Android Studio with the Flutter and Dart plugins, are recommended.

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sherrywilly/bim-ui-flutter.git
    cd bim-ui-flutter
    ```

2.  **Get Flutter dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
    This command fetches all the packages listed in `pubspec.yaml`.

3.  **Run the application**:
    To run the application on a connected device or emulator, execute:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    To run the web version, use:
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
    (Replace `chrome` with your preferred web browser if needed).

    You can also open the project in your IDE (VS Code or Android Studio) and use their built-in run functionalities.
